        <h4>Description</h4>
            This is my revised version of another pork fried rice recipe.
            I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything.
            I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference.
            I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. Enjoy.
            
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped carrot</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped broccoli</li>
                <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, carrot, broccoli, peas, and green onion 
                    in melted butter until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove pork mixture to a bowl and return skillet to medium heat.</li>
